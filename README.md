# Causal-Analysis-on-Crop-Yields-
This repository includes a series of R codes used in a paper comparing several statistical methods for assessing the levels of maize and sunflower yield losses induced by drought and cold events occuring in France (C. Mendes et al. Causal analysis methods for estimating the impact of drought and cold events on crop yields). 
Several causal analysis methods were implemented and compared:
- Inverse Probability Weighting,
- Matching,
- Standardization,
- Double robust.

These methods were applied to yield time series covering all major producing regions in France using both linear regression models and machine learning models.
